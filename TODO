* Cretaceous - Paleogene Extinction Event does not show at end of Late Cretaecous due to being
  66-65Ma. Might be good to modify values so it starts to show.

* Address logging to console - maybe use react-native-logging?

* Help buttons for each visual, inc. legend

* Clock overlay
 * Recolour with geological timeline colour scheme?

* cat * | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l => 62436
 * Consider including those without wikilinks
 * Layer on paleodb original data using its api - whether wikilink or not.
  * https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/taxa/single.txt?name=Annea&show=ref   <---- taxon_id
  * Needs to extract basic useful info using API - https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/
  * https://paleobiodb.org/classic/basicTaxonInfo?taxon_no=${taxon_id}   <---- webpage only

* Tooltips to quick wiki definition

* Create a "Walking with Dinosaurs" query
 * Finds and returns all those organisms 'tagged' with a specific tag
 * Tags become categories?
  * Rather than changing the phylum why not add these as tags
   - birds - Aves
   - dinosaurs - Dinosauria
   - mammals
   - hominids
   - fish

* Filtering on legend
 * Consider how to multi-select then do 1 update
 * Filter by search-term, ie. only show those that conform with terms,
   eg. only show "australopithecus" or "*saurus" or "Dino*"
