* Add a Readme for github

* Create limit queries for subjects to return MAX (TBD)
 ** 857 plants
 ** Bin-packing algorithm to group the plants into non-overlapping 'bins'
 ** Bin optimisation to have tolerance of X number of lanes (X TBD)
  - ie. If 2 plants overlap then can add 2nd up to X lanes
 ** Deduce minimum number of bins by experimenting with tolerance

    X                  XY                 Y
    |      --A-- --B--  |  --C-- --D--    |
    |        --E-- --F--|     --G-- --H-- |

* Create visual "next" / "prev" for displaying next MAX

* Search will search for subject then show MAX that contains it

* Need more obvious selection highlighting

* Search still seems to show interval rather than subject use "Aspidella" to debug

* Add lower margin to bottom of legend to show there is no overflow

* Data to Fix
 ** Nypa or NYPA may refer to: Nypa (plant), a genus of palms New York Power Authority Not Your Personal Army, a phrase commonly used by Anonymous
