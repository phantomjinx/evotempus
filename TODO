* Tooltips to quick wiki definition

* Create a "Walking with Dinosaurs" query
 * Finds and returns all those organisms 'tagged' with a specific tag
 * Tags become categories?
  * Rather than changing the phylum why not add these as tags
   - birds - Aves
   - dinosaurs - Dinosauria
   - mammals
   - hominids
   - fish

* Filtering on legend
 * Filter by search-term, ie. only show those that conform with terms,
   eg. only show "australopithecus" or "*saurus" or "Dino*"
