* Add a Readme for github

* Create limit queries for subjects to return MAX (TBD)
 ** 857 plants
 ** Bin-packing algorithm to group the plants into non-overlapping 'bins'
 ** Bin optimisation to have tolerance of X number of lanes (X TBD)
  - ie. If 2 plants overlap then can add 2nd up to X lanes
 ** Deduce minimum number of bins by experimenting with tolerance

    X                  XY                 Y

THE PROBLEM
1. I want to return a page of 50 subjects to display in my kind block
 Q. Which 50 do I pick?
 Q. What's the next 50 I pick?
2. My kind for the whole interval could contain up to 20000 subjects
 Q. Which 50 do I pick from 20000?
 Q. Do I sort them into categories?
 - Adv: All Molluscs displayed together.
 - Dis: Have to scroll through Molluscs to get to Chordata
 - Dis: Lots of Molluscs may be all the same time-frame so packing doesn't work
 - Dis: Not sorting them causes confusion as to what a page means
3. What am I trying to show?
 - For each interval (even whole), visualise subject existence in relation to one another
  eg. where was Stegosaurus in relation to T-Rex?

* Add a page column to subject:
  Name    Kind       From  To  Page  Lane
  T-Rex   Dinosauria --    --  8     12
  YYY     Chordata   --    -   9      4

* if 9000 in a 'group' then 50 / page --> 180 pages

//
// TODO
//
// To incorporate this new projection of data, we need to:
// 1. 5 queries with kind rather than 1 big one in to allow scaling
// 2. Look at subjectVisual and fetch the headings separately from hints
// 3. Then we can display a blank version of the visual complete with 15 lanes
// 4. On loading of the visual for the firstime, page will be set to 1
// 5. Worry about search later
// 6. Clicking on next with up page to 2 and we return 2
// 7. Make sure a count of all subjects is added to projection so client knows to enable next
// 8. Only re-render the SVG parts for the kind being updated
//

* What to return the same order of subjects each time so that I can flick to the same page and
  find the same subjects

* Create visual "next" / "prev" for displaying next MAX

* Search will search for subject then show MAX that contains it

* Need more obvious selection highlighting

* Search still seems to show interval rather than subject use "Aspidella" to debug

* Add lower margin to bottom of legend to show there is no overflow

* Data to Fix
 ** Nypa or NYPA may refer to: Nypa (plant), a genus of palms New York Power Authority Not Your Personal Army, a phrase commonly used by Anonymous
